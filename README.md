# Xash3D FWGS Engine [![Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/21970/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/tyabus-xash3d) [![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/tyabus/xash3d/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/tyabus/xash3d/-/pipelines) [![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/tyabus/xash3d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tyabus/xash3d)

Latest version of the engine is available at:
https://github.com/tyabus/xash3d

Orignal project: [Xash3D on ModDB](http://www.moddb.com/engines/xash3d-engine)

Xash3D Engine is a custom Gold Source engine rewritten from scratch. Xash3D
is compatible with many of the Gold Source games and mods and should be
able to run almost any existing singleplayer Half-Life mod without a hitch.
The multiplayer part is not yet completed, multiplayer mods should work just
fine, but bear in mind that some features may not work at all or work not
exactly the way they do in Gold Source Engine.

Xash3D FWGS is a fork of Xash3D Engine, which aims on crossplatform and compatibility
with original Xash3D and Gold Source.
